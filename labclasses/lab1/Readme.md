This is a simple assignment requiring no new knowledge from this course, 
but gathering the skills from other programming related courses.

Your mission is to implement a few simple functions, create automated tests, test them, 
and convince others that your code is correct.

You may start by creating a project in Eclipse, IntelliJ or Visual Studio Code, 
inspect the implementations in files `Lab1.java` and `MyIntegerList.java` and run 
the JUnit tests of file `Lab1Tests`.
